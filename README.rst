A script at ``contrib/conda.sh`` is provided to install the dependency with
`Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`__.

The following command builds and installs SOLVCON::

  $ python setup.py install

After installed you can run the unit tests::

  $ python -c 'import solvcon as sc; sc.test()'

Additional build and tests:

- Building document requires `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ 1.3.1+,
  `pstake <http://pstake.readthedocs.org/>`_ 0.3.4+, `Sphinxcontrib issue
  tracker <http://sphinxcontrib-issuetracker.readthedocs.org/>`__ 0.11, and
  `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ 2.28+.  Once the binary of SOLVCON is
  built, the following commands can build the document::

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

  The built document will be available at ``doc/build/html/``.

- When building SOLVCON locally::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

  You can run unit tests with Nose_::

    $ nosetests

- Another set of tests are collected in ``ftests/`` directory, and can be run
  with::

    $ nosetests ftests/*

  Some tests in ``ftests/`` involve remote procedure call (RPC) that uses `ssh
  <http://www.openssh.com/>`_.  You need to set up the public key
  authentication to properly run them.
